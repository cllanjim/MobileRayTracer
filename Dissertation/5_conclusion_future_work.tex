\chapter{Conclusion \& Future work}

\section{Conclusions}

\par
The constant evolution of technology allowed to leverage and massify the mobile devices.
With more and increasingly powerful mobile devices, it is possible to perform more and more complex and useful tasks in them.
This is a huge market where the programmers can develop their applications to and where the development time can be a huge factor in their career success.

\par
But as noted in this pre-dissertation report, there is clearly a lack of well documented rendering libraries for mobile systems.
There is then the need to change this reality, since more and more the Internet of Things is more present each passing year, because there are increasingly powerful mobile systems.

\par
As it is possible to address a huge number of challenges while developing the ray tracer, this pre-dissertation identified some of the strategic decisions to be performed in this dissertation project and its related challenges that may arise during the development.

\section{Future Work}

\par
With respect to future work, it should be the development of the library for Android and the analysis of possibilities and challenges that may arise.
Upon completion of the development process, besides writing the dissertation and the article, it is expected to provide a demo application in order to illustrate the functionalities and performance that the library will offer.
